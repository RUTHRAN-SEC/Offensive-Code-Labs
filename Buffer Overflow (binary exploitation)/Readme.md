# Buffer Overflow Demonstration in C

## Overview of the code

This project demonstrates a classic **Buffer Overflow vulnerability** using the C programming language.

It shows how unsafe input handling — specifically using `scanf("%s")` — can overwrite adjacent memory when the input exceeds the allocated buffer size.

The goal of this project is educational: to understand how buffer overflows occur and why proper input validation is critical in secure software development.

## Objective of the BUffer Over Flow

- Understand how buffer overflow vulnerabilities happen.
- Learn why `scanf("%s")` is unsafe when input length is not restricted.
- Observe how memory corruption affects program behavior.
- Recognize the importance of secure coding practices.

---

## Vulnerable Code Concept

The program defines a fixed size character array:
- char buffer[10];

The program then takes user input using:
- scanf("%s", buffer);

The issue:
- scanf("%s") does not check input length.

If the user enters more than 9 characters (10 including null terminator), the extra data overflows into adjacent memory.

### How Buffer Overflow Occurs
- A buffer of 10 bytes is allocated.
- The user enters a string longer than 9 characters.
- scanf("%s") writes beyond the allocated memory.
- Adjacent memory locations are overwritten.

### Example input:

This input exceeds the buffer capacity and causes memory corruption.
- abcdefghijk

### Possible Effects of Buffer Overflow
- Program crash
- Corrupted variables
- Unexpected output
- Undefined behavior
- Security vulnerabilities

In real world applications, buffer overflows can lead to:

- Code execution
- Privilege escalation
- Remote exploitation


## Secure Alternative

Instead of:
- scanf("%s", buffer);

Use safer alternatives:
- scanf("%9s", buffer);   OR  fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);

These methods limit the number of characters read and help prevent overflow.

### Important Things To Note
- Never trust user input.
- Always validate input length.
- Avoid unsafe functions in C.
- Use bounded input functions.
- Secure coding prevents serious vulnerabilities.
