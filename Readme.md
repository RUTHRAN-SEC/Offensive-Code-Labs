# Offensive Code Labs

## Overview

**Offensive Code Labs** is a hands on cybersecurity repository designed to demonstrate common security vulnerabilities, cryptographic concepts, and defensive security mechanisms through practical code examples.

This repository contains small, focused projects that simulate real-world security flaws and analysis techniques. The goal is to strengthen understanding of both offensive and defensive security concepts by building and testing vulnerable applications in a controlled lab environment.

> ⚠️ All projects are created strictly for educational and ethical learning purposes.

## Repository Contains

### 1.Buffer Overflow (Binary Exploitation)

**Category:** Binary Exploitation  
**Language:** C  

Demonstrates how improper input handling in C can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

**Key Concepts:**
- Stack memory layout
- Unsafe functions (`scanf("%s")`)
- Memory corruption
- Undefined behavior
- Secure input handling

This lab helps understand how low-level memory vulnerabilities occur and why secure coding practices are critical in system-level programming.

### 2.Caesar Cipher (Cryptography)

**Category:** Cryptography  
**Language:** Python  

Implements the classic Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption technique.

**Key Concepts:**
- Basic encryption algorithms
- Character shifting logic
- Symmetric encryption fundamentals
- Brute-force possibilities

This project introduces fundamental cryptographic principles in a simple and understandable way.

### 3.Password Policy Analyzer (Defensive Security)

**Category:** Defensive Security  
**Language:** Python  

Analyzes password strength based on defined security policies.

**Key Concepts:**
- Input validation
- Password complexity requirements
- Security policy enforcement
- Defensive programming

This lab demonstrates how organizations can enforce strong password policies to prevent weak credential attacks.

### 4.Web Security Labs

**Category:** Web Application Security  
**Technologies:** PHP / HTML / SQL  

This section demonstrates common web vulnerabilities:

#### • Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Reflected input vulnerability
- Script injection risks
- Importance of output encoding

#### • SQL Injection
- Unsanitized query inputs
- Authentication bypass scenarios
- Importance of parameterized queries

#### • PHP Session Attacks
- Session hijacking concepts
